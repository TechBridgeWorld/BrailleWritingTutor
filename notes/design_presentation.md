What is design?
-----------------------------------------
* Research is a process, Design is a practice
* Research -> Knowledge as Design -> Purpose
* Mix of engineering and art
  - (aesthetics and technology)
  - mix of thinking and feeling
* Mix of creative and logical proccesses
* Defer judgement
  - (express/create) -> (judge)

Design process
------------------------------------------
* Early stages make sure the design you're working on is useful
* Middle phase (concept design) makes it usable
* Final phase delights them
* Good design includes large part of first phase

4 kinds of design research
------------------------------------------
* "Design through research"
  - coming up with plan to build something
  - studious
* "Design of research"
  - designing a piece of research (in week planning, discussions, etc.)
  - formative
* "Research on design"
  - research team studies designer process and improves
  - diagnostic (nightline IDEO show)
* "Research through design"
  - people designing something, and in doing so they improve their process
  - embedded (happens anyway, intuitive)

* Escape the dreaded "studious" square
* Research uses research methods. Design research creates new methods


Concrete things
-----------------------------------------
* List 50 potential things, just do a few of them
