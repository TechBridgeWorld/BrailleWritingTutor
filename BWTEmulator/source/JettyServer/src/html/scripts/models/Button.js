/** @file Button.js
 *  @brief Class that represents a button. Used to send an AJAX request to
 *         our local server.
 *
 *  Buttons attempt to emulate the hardware as much as possible. On button
 *  press down, the button's code is sent to the server, and this button
 *  is added to the __BUTTONS_HELD queue. A setInterval loop iterates over
 *  all buttons currently being held and sends their codes every
 *  QUEUE_TIMER_RATE ms. On button up, another code is sent to the server. This
 *  allows certain edge cases to arise that currently exist in the hardware. For
 *  example, pressing the slate very quickly on the physical hardware doesn't
 *  register on the existing software if the slate press is so short that only 2
 *  bytecodes are sent. This is emulated in the emulator by clicking such that
 *  the setInterval loop fails to send the bytecode before the button up event.
 *
 *  Usage: var btn = new Button({
 *           'code': 'a n',
 *           'success': function(data) { console.log(data); },
 *           'failure': function(data) { console.log(data); }
 *         });
